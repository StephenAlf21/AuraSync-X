            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to AuraSync X (“AuraSync”, “Service”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form a legally binding contract between you (“you”, “your”, or “User”) and us regarding your use of the AuraSync web application, including its 3-D Music Visualizer and MP4 Video Player (collectively, the “Applications”). By accessing or using any part of the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.</p>

            <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Content</strong> – Any text, graphics, audio, video, code, or other materials uploaded, streamed, or otherwise made available through the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>Local Processing</strong> – Execution of code entirely within your browser or device without transmission of files to our servers.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Data</strong> – Information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, as defined under applicable privacy laws.</p>

            <h2>3. Eligibility & Age Requirements</h2>
            <p>You must be (a) at least the age of majority in your province, state, or country; or (b) 13 years or older and have your parent or legal guardian’s consent to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.</p>

            <h2>4. Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
            <p>We may modify the Service or these Terms at any time. Material changes will be announced via an in-app notice or on our website at least 30 days before taking effect whenever required by Canadian or U.S. consumer-protection law. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

            <h2>5. License & Intellectual-Property Rights</h2>
            <h3>License to You</h3>
            <p>We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to access and use the Applications for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>
            <h3>Ownership</h3>
            <p>All right, title, and interest in the Service (including source code, visual interfaces, trademarks, and logos) remain with us and our licensors. The Terms do not transfer any intellectual-property rights except the limited licence above.</p>
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>If you submit ideas or suggestions, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, reproduce, and exploit that feedback without obligation to you.</p>

            <h2>6. User Content & Conduct</h2>
            <h3>Responsibility</h3>
            <p>All Content you load, stream, or display via the Service remains your sole responsibility.</p>
            <h3>Permissions</h3>
            <p>You must have all necessary rights (including copyright, neighbouring-rights, and public-performance rights) for any Content you use.</p>
            <h3>Prohibited Conduct</h3>
            <p>You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use Content that is unlawful, defamatory, obscene, hateful, or infringes intellectual-property or privacy rights;</li>
                <li>Circumvent or interfere with security features;</li>
                <li>Use automated means (bots, scrapers) to access or modify the Service;</li>
                <li>Reverse engineer, de-compile, or attempt to extract source code, except to the limited extent allowed by applicable law;</li>
                <li>Use the Service for commercial streaming, public performance, or any activity that violates applicable broadcasting statutes (e.g., Canadian Broadcasting Act, U.S. Copyright Act §§ 106–114).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Privacy & Data Processing</h2>
            <h3>No Server-Side Collection</h3>
            <p>AuraSync is designed for fully local processing. We do not collect, retain, or otherwise process Personal Data or media files on our servers.</p>
            <h3>Diagnostic Data</h3>
            <p>We may collect minimal, non-identifying diagnostic information (e.g., error logs) solely to maintain and improve Service stability. Such data are anonymised and never linked to an individual User.</p>
            <h3>EU/EEA Users</h3>
            <p>Because no Personal Data is processed, AuraSync is generally outside the material scope of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Should limited diagnostic data be deemed personal under GDPR, we rely on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR) in ensuring Service security.</p>

            <h2>8. Third-Party Content & Links</h2>
            <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites, radio streams, or other resources. We do not endorse, control, or assume responsibility for any third-party content. Accessing third-party resources is at your own risk and subject to their separate terms.</p>

            <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and uninterrupted or error-free operation. Because some jurisdictions (e.g., Québec, certain U.S. states, EU consumer-law) do not allow exclusions of certain warranties, these disclaimers may not apply to you in whole or in part.</p>

            <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall we (or our directors, officers, employees, or licensors) be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages (including loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses) arising out of or relating to the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability for all claims under these Terms shall not exceed CAD 100 (or the equivalent in your local currency).</p>
            <p>Certain consumer-protection statutes (e.g., Canadian Consumer Protection Acts, EU Directive 2019/771) may provide you additional rights; this clause does not override mandatory statutory protections.</p>

            <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from: (a) your breach of these Terms; (b) Content you load or stream via the Service; or (c) your violation of any law or third-party right.</p>

            <h2>12. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service immediately, without notice, if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, Sections 5–14 will survive.</p>

            <h2>13. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. You and we agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.</p>
            <p>For U.S. residents, any claim arising under U.S. federal law (e.g., 17 U.S.C. § 512) will be heard in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and state-law claims in the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, unless prohibited by consumer-protection statutes in your state of residence.</p>

            <h2>14. International Users</h2>
            <p>AuraSync is controlled from Canada. If you access the Service from outside Canada or the United States, you are responsible for compliance with local laws, including export-control regulations (e.g., EU Dual-Use Regulation 2021/821, U.S. Export Administration Regulations). Nothing in these Terms shall limit mandatory rights you have under the laws of your country of habitual residence.</p>

            <h2>15. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect, and the invalid provision will be interpreted to fulfil its intended purpose to the maximum lawful extent.</p>

            <h2>16. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, and understandings, whether oral or written.</p>

            <h2>17. Contact Information</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, alleged copyright infringement, or wish to exercise statutory rights (e.g., GDPR access request), please contact:</p>
